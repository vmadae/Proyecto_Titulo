"spear.v1","spear where the goal is to minimize the mean runtime of spear, an exact tree search solver for sat problems with 26 categorical parameters. we consider a budget of 10 000 runs, a maximum runtime of 300 cpu-seconds per run, and a training and a test set of 302 different sat instances.","./FileSystem/Files/Target/spear.v1/spear.v1_runner","./FileSystem/Files/Target/spear.v1/spear.v1_executable.zip","2022-06-16","2022-06-17"
"moaco","las instancias de referencia son instancias tsp euclidianas biobjetivas de tama?os {500, 600, 700, 800, 900, 1000}, 10 instancias de entrenamiento y 60 instancias de prueba de cada tama?o. usamos un presupuesto de 5 000 ejecuciones del marco moaco, y cada ejecuci?n de un algoritmo moaco se detiene despu?s de 4 ? (n/100)2 segundos de cpu, donde n es el tama?o de la instancia.","./FileSystem/Files/Target/moaco/moaco_runner","./FileSystem/Files/Target/moaco/moaco_executable.zip","2022-06-16","-"
"lingeling","the inner scheme follows the previously implemented lbd resp. glue based scheme as in glucose. as in the previous version the solver might switch to activities dynamically, if the glue distribution is skewed. the outer schedule is luby controlled and resets the learned clause data based limit to its initial size. this idea is particularly useful for crafted instances.","./FileSystem/Files/Target/lingeling/lingeling_runner","./FileSystem/Files/Target/lingeling/lingeling_executable.zip","2022-06-16","-"
"acotsp","acotsp is a software package that implements various ant colony optimization algorithms to tackle the symmetric traveling salesman problem (tsp). the configuration scenario illustrated here concerns the automatic configuration of all its 11 parameters. the goal is to find a configuration of acotsp that obtains the lowest solution cost in tsp instances within a given computation time limit. we explain here the setup of this configuration scenario.
